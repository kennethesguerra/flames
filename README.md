# FLAMES
A relationship calculator made using Vue JS. 
<p>FLAMES is an old school love calculator which means Friends, Love, Affection, Married, Enemy and Soulmates. However there are other meaning for each letters. When I was a kid, I used this method every time I have a crush on someone just for fun. </p>

<p>I tried to automate it to exercise string manipulation and logic. I made it using Vue JS as an exercise as I was trying to learn the framework.</p>
